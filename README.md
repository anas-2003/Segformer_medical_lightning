> Medical image segmentation is an innovative process that enables surgeons to have a virtual "x-ray vision." It is a highly valuable tool in healthcare, providing non-invasive diagnostics and in-depth analysis. With this in mind, in this post, we will explore the UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation Kaggle challenge dataset. As part of this project, we will utilize PyTorch along with PyTorch-Lightning. We will use ðŸ¤— HuggingFace transformers to load and fine-tune the Segformer transformer-based model on the medical segmentation dataset. Finally, we will create a Gradio app for image inference and deploy it on HuggingFace spaces.
