> Medical image segmentation is an innovative process that enables surgeons to have a virtual "x-ray vision." It is a highly valuable tool in healthcare, providing non-invasive diagnostics and in-depth analysis. With this in mind, in this post, we will explore the UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation Kaggle challenge dataset. As part of this project, we will utilize PyTorch along with PyTorch-Lightning. We will use ðŸ¤— HuggingFace transformers to load and fine-tune the Segformer transformer-based model on the medical segmentation dataset. Finally, we will create a Gradio app for image inference and deploy it on HuggingFace spaces.

# Install & Import Required Libraries
> Before we begin the coding part, we must ensure all the required libraries are installed. For this project, apart from PyTorch, we are installing additional tools to help ease the implementation process.

# What is Medical Image Segmentation?
> Medical image segmentation is a process that involves dividing medical images, such as CT scans or MRI scans, into distinct regions or structures of interest. This technique is used to identify and isolate specific areas within the image, which is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of diseases. It can be done manually by experts or automated using computer algorithms and machine learning. Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in various medical specialties and enables quantitative analysis and precise measurements.
